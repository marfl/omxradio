omxradio - A web interface for Raspberry Pi's omxplayer using node.js and youtube-dl.

To use this you must install node.js (required modules: appjs, express,	mime, googleapis) and youtube-dl . Tested on node v0.10.24 and youtube-dl 2012.02.27:
  $ node omxradio

IMPORTANT: Because of Youtube's new API (v3) you now need to provide your own API key in omxradio.js in order for this to work fully.

Web interface shows up on http://hostname:7000/ where hostname is the name/ip address of the Raspberry Pi. It is optimized for Google Chrome and/on Android ICS/JB.

Features:
  * Edit the html-page and put in your own radio stations
  * Play a file stored locally or from an URL
  * Play music (actually video if a monitor is connected) from Youtube.
  * Search on Youtube by keywords, video id or video url.
  * Play youtube playlist (songs go to queue); currently broken
  * Queue tracks!
  * Play/pause and stop current playing music.

Supported (tested) browsers:
  * Google Chrome 22
  * Google Chrome for Android 18 (Jelly Bean)
  * Google Chrome for iOS (ugly gui but usable)
  * Safari for iOS (ugly gui but usable)
  * Firefox 16
